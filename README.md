Monkeymind is a Software Defined Automation platform to enable expert systems use via LLM Agents. Monkeymind does this by acquiring relevant knowledge from its knowledge base and interpreting it according to the userâ€™s problem. The data in the knowledge base is added by humans who are experts in a particular domain and this software is used by a non-expert user to acquire some information. it provides a modular software system that enables sharing and interoperability between multiple fleets of robots and physical infrastructure, like doors, elevators, and building management systems, and enables seamless integration with its environment using 

### Software-Defined:

"Software-defined" generally refers to an approach where the functionality of a system is controlled and managed by software rather than being hard-coded or dependent on physical hardware. This concept is commonly associated with software-defined networking (SDN), where network management is done through software applications rather than the traditional approach of configuring hardware devices.

### Automation:

Automation involves the use of technology to perform tasks or processes with minimal human intervention. This can include the automation of repetitive tasks, workflows, or even complex business processes.

Monkey mind provides a higher level of abstraction than the SDK enabling robot fleets to communicate with each other and its environment when planning missions or scheduling and executing tasks and provides tools, libraries and APIs that enable the next generation of robots

# Features

## Current

1. Graph RAG
2. Customizable Small Language Model
3. Agentic components, including routing, memory and tool use
4. Distributed Data pipeline for pretraining
5. Easy Deployment using docker compose 
6. Lifecycle APIs and scripts for pretraing and finetuning 
7. RAFT Capabilities
